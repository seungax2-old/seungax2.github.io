QUESTION/PROBLEM
How to fix adb devices shows unauthorized device?

APPLIES TO
Android 4, Android 6, Android 7, Android 8

RESOLUTION
Possible solutions if "adb devices" shows a device as "unauthorized":

C:\Users\JohnDoo>adb devices
List of devices attached
17310D821D      unauthorized

1.Disconnect USB between PC and device
2.Stop adb server by entering "adb kill-server" in command window
3.On device use "Revoke USB debugging authorizations" in "Developer Options"
4.On PC delete "adbkey" file in user directory, for example "C:\Users\JohnDoo\.android"
5.Reconnect the device to the PC
6.Open a command window and enter "adb devices". Watch the device's screen for any Authorization message and allow the connection.

7.The device should now show as "device":
 
C:\Users\JohnDoo>adb devices
List of devices attached
17310D821D      device
If the above does not help, re-installing adb and or USB drivers may help.
